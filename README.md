# Face-Recognition-Using-CNN-and-LBPH

For this project i have used opencv package to get the images form the webcam of the laptop and use those images to build a model using opencv and deep learing. For now the model build using Local Binary Patterns and Histogram is ready to use and i am current working on perfecting my CNN model.<br></br>

FaceData_Collection_Augmentaion.py will take 100 images through webcam and store it in a give loction and it will also augment the images and store it in other folder. The augmented images will be used for CNN model.<br></br>

Suggestion would be appreciated. Thank you
