# Face-Recognition-Using-CNN-and-LBPH

For this project i have used opencv package to get the images form the webcam of the laptop and use those images to build a model using opencv and deep learing. For now the model build using Local Binary Patterns and Histogram is ready to use and i am current working on perfecting my CNN model.
